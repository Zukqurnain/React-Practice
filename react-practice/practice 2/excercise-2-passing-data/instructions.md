# Instructions

Let's do something a little bit more complicated. Instead of displaying a
list of users and their movies, this time you need to display a list of movies.

For each book in the list, there are two options:

1. If the book has been liked by any of the peeps, then display a list of all of the peeps who said that they liked that book.
2. If the book has *not* been liked, display some text stating that no one liked this book.

As you go about tackling this project, try to make the app *modular* by breaking it into resusable React components.

## Example


<h2>Imran Series</h2>
<p>Liked By:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fazal Deen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Jokes 101</h2>
<p>Liked By:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Muneeb</li>
  <li>Osama</li>
</ul>

<h2>I Am Malala</h2>
<p>None of the peeps in the chart liked this book</p>

{chart.map((i, ind) => (i.bookLikedID == books[x].id) ?  " Liked By " + peeps[i.peepsID].name  : "" )}
